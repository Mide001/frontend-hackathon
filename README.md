Our Building Process

In building this Project, we arrived at (not sure how you did, but here is a draft) the following pages for in the application:


A Landing Page, listing all the features of the platform and clarifications for end users

A Create page, where Creatives get to upload their art after filling a form

A Mini-Marketplace, where all the live tokens and NFTs are listed here for selling and trading

The Accounts section, where users get to see all their NFTs and can choose how they want to list their NFTs in the marketplace, choosing from two options, either publish as NFT or publish as a Fractionalized NFT - from the same page and even control the sale of these assets.
